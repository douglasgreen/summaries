# Thus Spake Zarathustra, by Friedrich Nietzsche

## Introduction: How Zarathustra Came Into Being

Alright, let's talk about the Introduction to *Thus Spake Zarathustra*. This part isn't by Nietzsche himself, but by his sister, Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche.

She tells us this book was incredibly personal for her brother. It wasn't just philosophy; it was like a diary of his deepest feelings, his friendships, his hopes, and even his biggest disappointments.

The main character, Zarathustra, was apparently an idea Nietzsche had thought about since he was a child. He eventually chose the name Zarathustra, linking it to the ancient Persians, who he felt had a big-picture view of history and prophets.

Elisabeth explains that many of the core ideas in the book, especially the famous "Superman," weren't entirely new when he wrote *Zarathustra*. Nietzsche had been thinking and writing about the potential for humanity to produce truly great individuals for years before. He believed we should aim to create people who are higher and better than what we've seen so far.

She clarifies what Nietzsche meant by the "Superman." It's not about a specific race or a comic book hero. It's about creating a *type* of human who embodies strength, creativity, and a love for life. This involves a radical shift in values – what Nietzsche called the "Transvaluation of all Values." Basically, he felt traditional morality, especially Christian morality, praised weakness and held humanity back. He wanted new values that celebrated power, health, and affirming life. The Superman is the goal, someone possible *now* if we change our values.

She also introduces the idea of "Great Healthiness." This isn't just about being physically well. It's about having a strong, resilient spirit, able to explore everything, endure hardship, and always bounce back, becoming even stronger and more joyful. This is key to becoming the Superman.

Then, she talks about how the book actually got written. A major trigger was Nietzsche's idea of the "Eternal Recurrence" – the thought that everything in life will repeat itself infinitely. This idea hit him strongly in the summer of 1881 while walking in the mountains.

His health was actually improving around this time, giving him energy. But he also went through painful personal experiences, feeling very lonely and misunderstood by friends. His sister suggests this suffering, combined with his returning strength, fueled the creation of Zarathustra, who became a kind of ideal companion for him.

She gives us details about where and when he wrote the different parts. Part 1 was written very quickly, in about ten days, near Rapallo, Italy, despite bad weather and illness. Part 2 came just as fast the next summer back in the Swiss mountains. Part 3 was written in Nice, France, where the good weather seemed to help his creativity. He described the writing process as intensely inspired, almost like being taken over by a powerful force, with ideas flooding his mind while walking or even dancing.

The Fourth Part took longer to write and was initially printed privately just for a few trusted friends. Nietzsche felt very isolated, and only gave out seven copies.

Finally, Elisabeth explains why Nietzsche chose the name Zarathustra. The original Zarathustra (or Zoroaster) was the thinker who first framed the world as a struggle between good and evil – basically, inventing morality as we know it. Nietzsche thought this was a huge error. So, he felt it was fitting that Zarathustra, the *creator* of morality, should also be the one to *overcome* it, through honesty and truthfulness. For Nietzsche, using Zarathustra was a way of showing this overcoming of old morals.

So, this introduction sets the stage, showing us the personal background, the core ideas like the Superman and Eternal Recurrence, the intense writing process, and the meaning behind the main character's name.

## First Part: Zarathustra's Discourses

### Zarathustra's Prologue

So, we begin with Zarathustra's Prologue. This sets the scene for everything that follows.

**Section 1: Zarathustra Decides to Descend**

Zarathustra has spent ten years alone in the mountains, thinking and learning. He's become full of wisdom. So full, in fact, he feels like a cup that's about to overflow. He feels he *needs* to share this wisdom with people. He talks to the sun, saying he wants to 'go down' from the mountain, like the sun sets, and bring his light, his knowledge, to humanity. He feels ready to become a man among men again.

**Section 2: The Saint in the Forest**

As Zarathustra comes down the mountain, he meets an old saint living in the forest. The saint recognizes Zarathustra from years ago. He wonders why Zarathustra is going back to people. The saint himself left humanity because he loved them *too* much, and now he prefers to love God alone. He warns Zarathustra that people won't trust him or want his gifts. Zarathustra replies he's bringing gifts, not charity. As they part ways, laughing, Zarathustra has a shocking thought: This old saint, living alone, hasn't even heard the news that "God is dead."

**Section 3: Preaching the Superman**

Zarathustra arrives at a town where people are gathered in the marketplace, waiting to see a rope-dancer. Zarathustra takes this chance to speak to the crowd. He announces his main message: "I teach you the Superman!" He tells them that humanity is something that needs to be overcome, just like apes were overcome by humans. Man is a bridge, not the final destination. The "Superman," he says, is the goal, the *meaning of the Earth*. He urges them to stay true to the Earth and reject promises of heavenly afterlives. He says the old focus on the soul despising the body was wrong. He challenges the people, asking if they feel truly great, or just comfortable and complacent. He wants them to feel a "great contempt" for their current state, to long for something more. But the crowd doesn't really listen; they just want to see the rope-dancer.

**Section 4: Man as a Bridge**

Zarathustra looks at the people and reflects. He sees man as a dangerous rope stretched over an abyss, between the animal and the Superman. He says what's great about humans is this potential to be a bridge, an "over-going" and a "down-going." He declares his love for those who strive, who despise their current limitations, who sacrifice themselves for the future possibility of the Superman, who live for knowledge and creation, and who see their own virtues as part of this striving towards something higher. He calls himself a herald of this future, the Superman, who is like lightning from a dark cloud.

**Section 5: The Last Man**

Realizing the crowd still doesn't understand him, Zarathustra decides to talk about the *opposite* of the Superman. He calls this the "Last Man." He warns that a time is coming when humanity will lose its ambition, its desire to strive for anything great. The Last Man is the ultimate picture of comfort and complacency. These people make everything small. They avoid risk, seek only warmth and tiny pleasures day and night. They say, "We have discovered happiness," and they blink. Everyone is equal, no one wants to lead or follow, and anyone different is seen as crazy. They have no chaos in them, so they can't create anything new, like a "dancing star." The crowd, ironically, *loves* this idea! They shout, "Give us this Last Man, O Zarathustra!" Zarathustra becomes sad, realizing he's completely misunderstood.

**Section 6 & 7: The Rope-Dancer's Fall and Death**

Just then, the rope-dancer starts his act. But a jester, a clown figure, comes out, taunts him, and jumps over him. The rope-dancer loses his balance and falls to the ground near Zarathustra. He's dying. The man thinks the devil tripped him and is dragging him to hell. Zarathustra kneels beside him and comforts him, saying there's no devil and no hell. He tells the man his soul will die with his body, so he has nothing to fear. Zarathustra respects the man because he made danger his profession. He promises to bury the man himself. As night falls and the crowd leaves, Zarathustra sits with the body, realizing his first attempt to teach humanity has ended with him holding a corpse, feeling like a fool.

**Section 8: Leaving the Town**

Zarathustra carries the corpse out of the town. The jester appears again and warns him to leave, saying everyone hates him – the good, the just, the believers. Even the gravediggers mock Zarathustra as he leaves the town gate. He walks for hours through forests and swamps, eventually stopping at a hermit's hut for food and drink.

**Section 9: The Need for Companions**

After resting, Zarathustra puts the corpse in a hollow tree to protect it from wolves and falls asleep. He sleeps deeply. When he wakes, he has a new clarity, a new truth. He realizes his mistake wasn't *what* he taught, but *who* he taught. He shouldn't speak to the "people," the "herd." They aren't ready. He needs *companions* – living individuals who want to follow their *own* path alongside him, fellow creators who can help break old values and write new ones. He decides he won't be a shepherd for the masses anymore. He leaves the corpse behind, symbolizing leaving behind his failure and that way of teaching.

**Section 10: The Eagle and the Serpent**

As Zarathustra embraces this new direction, he looks up and sees his symbolic animals: an eagle, representing pride, circling high above, and a serpent, representing wisdom, coiled around its neck like a friend. He rejoices, seeing them as a sign that he's on the right path and that they will guide him. He accepts that his path will be dangerous, especially among men. He hopes his pride and wisdom will always stay together. This, the text says, is the *real* beginning of Zarathustra's journey, his "down-going" with a new purpose.

## Zarathustra's Discourses

**Introduction to Zarathustra's Discourses**

Now we move into the first part of Zarathustra's actual teachings. These are often called his Discourses. He delivers these talks after leaving the mountains and realizing he needs companions, not just a crowd. He's staying in a town nicknamed "The Pied Cow."

---

**I. The Three Metamorphoses**

Zarathustra starts by talking about how the human spirit changes and grows. He describes three stages, like transformations or metamorphoses.

First, the spirit becomes a **Camel**. The Camel is strong and respectful. It kneels down and asks, "What's the heaviest burden I can carry?" It takes on duties, hardships, traditions, and self-denial, carrying them into the lonely wilderness. Think of this as the stage of discipline and accepting established values.

Second, in the wilderness, the spirit transforms into a **Lion**. The Lion wants freedom. It fights against the old master, the great dragon called "Thou Shalt." This dragon represents all the old rules and values that command us. The Lion roars "I Will!" It wants to be its own master. The Lion destroys the old values to create freedom, saying a powerful "No" to duty. But the Lion can only destroy; it can't create *new* values yet.

Third, the Lion must become a **Child**. The Child is innocence and forgetfulness. It's a fresh start, like a game or a wheel rolling on its own. The Child represents pure creation. It says a "Holy Yes" to life, creating new values playfully and freely, out of its own will. This is the stage needed for true creation.

So, the spirit must first learn discipline (Camel), then rebel and win freedom (Lion), and finally become a creator of new values (Child).

---

**II. The Academic Chairs of Virtue**

Next, Zarathustra visits a town where a wise man is famous for teaching about virtue and sleep. The youths all gather to listen to him.

This wise man teaches that the goal of virtue is... getting a good night's sleep! He lists things you should do: overcome yourself ten times a day, reconcile with yourself, find ten truths, laugh ten times – all so you can sleep well. Avoid bad deeds because they disturb sleep. Even send your virtues themselves to sleep so they don't quarrel! He values peace, obedience to government (even crooked ones!), having a good reputation, and avoiding too much excitement. His wisdom is basically about keeping awake *just enough* during the day to ensure peaceful, dreamless sleep at night.

Zarathustra listens and laughs to himself. He realizes this is the kind of "wisdom" people often seek from teachers of virtue: a way to achieve comfortable numbness, a sleep without dreams. They want poppy-head virtues that dull the soul. Zarathustra sees this as a very low view of life. He thinks these teachers are outdated and essentially already asleep, even when they're awake. They mistake drowsiness for wisdom.

---

**III. Backworldsmen**

Zarathustra reflects on his own past beliefs. He admits that he, too, used to believe in "backworlds" – other worlds beyond this one, like heaven or a spiritual realm. He saw the world as the creation of a suffering God, a flawed dream.

But now he realizes that these ideas of God and other worlds were just human inventions, born out of suffering and weariness. People who couldn't cope with this life, who despised their own bodies and the earth, invented these escape routes. They projected their hopes and fears onto a "beyond."

Zarathustra calls himself a "convalescent," someone recovering from this sickness of belief in backworlds. He now teaches a new pride: to love the *earth* and the *body*. Our heads should be *terrestrial* heads, giving meaning to *this* world, not searching for meaning elsewhere. He says the body is real, the ego is real, and they speak more honestly about existence than any phantom God. He urges people to embrace the path humanity has followed, here on earth, and affirm it, rather than trying to escape it like the sick and dying who invented heavenly hopes. Even those who claim to believe in backworlds, he suspects, secretly believe most strongly in their own bodies. He calls for listening to the *healthy* body, which speaks of the meaning of the earth.

---

**IV. The Despisers of the Body**

Zarathustra directly addresses those who look down on the physical body. He wants them just to say goodbye to their bodies and be silent, because their thinking is flawed.

He points out that even a child says "Body am I, and soul." But the truly awake person knows: "Body am I *entirely*." The soul, or spirit, isn't separate; it's just a tool, a "little sagacity," belonging to the body's "big sagacity."

There's a deeper force within us, he says, called the "Self." This Self *is* the body. It's wiser than our conscious thoughts or "ego." The Self guides the ego, makes it feel pain so it learns to avoid harm, makes it feel pleasure so it learns what's good for it. The Self is the real ruler, the deeper intelligence.

Why do people despise the body? Zarathustra suggests it's because their *Self* – their fundamental life-force – has become weak. It no longer has the power to create *beyond* itself. This deep inner desire to create is frustrated. Because they can no longer create, their Self secretly *wants* to perish, and this translates into despising the body, life, and the earth. They become angry and envious. Zarathustra declares he won't follow their path; they are not bridges to the Superman.

---

**V. Joys and Passions**

Zarathustra talks about virtues and where they come from. He says if you have a virtue that is truly *yours*, it's unique to you. Don't just give it a common name and make it part of the herd. Let it be nameless, something deeply personal. Desire it because it pleases *you*, not because it's some external law.

He suggests that our virtues actually grow *out of* our passions, which we once might have called "evil." When you channel your passions towards your highest goals, they transform into virtues and joys. Your wild impulses, your anger, your desires – they can all become positive forces, like turning poisons into medicine.

He warns, though, that having many virtues can be difficult. It can create inner conflict, like a battlefield. Virtues can be jealous of each other, each wanting to dominate your whole spirit. This inner conflict, this "evil" arising from the struggle *between* virtues, is necessary. He even suggests that envy and distrust *among* virtues are needed. Ultimately, man must be surpassed, and loving your virtues means accepting that you might even perish *because* of their inner conflicts and intensity.

---

**VI. The Pale Criminal**

Zarathustra observes a criminal who is pale with guilt and self-contempt after his deed. He speaks to the judges, saying their killing should be pity, not revenge. Their act should justify *life*, perhaps by seeing the condemned man's suffering as a step towards the Superman.

He argues that the criminal's real problem isn't just the crime itself, but his inability to bear the *idea* of the crime afterward. He became obsessed with his single act. Zarathustra calls this "madness after the deed."

But there's also a "madness before the deed." He suggests the judges don't understand the criminal's soul. Maybe the man didn't just want robbery; maybe his soul craved blood, the "happiness of the knife." His weak reason couldn't grasp this primal urge and instead rationalized it as wanting booty or revenge. Now, the guilt crushes him.

Zarathustra sees the criminal as a "mass of diseases" reaching out, a "coil of wild serpents." The unhealthy body's suffering was misinterpreted by the soul as a murderous desire. He contrasts this with past ages where different things were considered evil (like doubt). He wishes the "good people" had a similar madness that would lead them to overcome their wretched self-complacency, rather than just living long, virtuous, boring lives. He declares he is a railing beside a torrent – people can grasp him if they can, but he won't be a crutch for the weak.

---

**VII. Reading and Writing**

Zarathustra talks about communication. He only loves writing that comes from the heart, written "with blood," because blood is spirit. He hates casual readers and believes that widespread literacy can actually ruin both writing and thinking, making spirit commonplace or "populace."

Writing born of passion and insight shouldn't just be read; it should be learned by heart. He compares deep sayings or proverbs to mountain peaks – you need "long legs" (a capable mind) to traverse them. The atmosphere should be clear, sharp, even joyful in its danger.

He values courage, laughter, and lightness. He wants to be surrounded by playful spirits (goblins), not seriousness. He feels disconnected from the crowd below; their concerns are like a thundercloud he laughs at from his height. He asks, "Who can laugh and be exalted at the same time?" True wisdom, he says, is like a woman who loves a warrior – courageous, unconcerned, scornful.

He dismisses the complaint that "life is hard to bear." We should be strong, not delicate. Love life because we love *loving*, not just out of habit. There's madness in love, but also method. He finds joy in light things like butterflies and bubbles. He declares, "I should only believe in a God that would know how to dance." He contrasts this with the "spirit of gravity" – seriousness, solemnity – which makes things fall. We should slay this spirit not with anger, but with laughter. He feels light, he flies, he dances – a God dances in him.

---

**VIII. The Tree on the Hill**

Zarathustra notices a youth avoiding him. He finds the youth sitting sadly under a tree on a hill. Zarathustra uses the tree as a metaphor. Just as a tree reaching for the heights must also send its roots deep into the earth, even into the "evil" (the dark, the difficult), so must a person aiming high.

The youth cries out that Zarathustra has seen his soul. He feels unstable because he changes too quickly, his "today refutes his yesterday." He feels alone and full of contempt on the heights, ashamed of his struggle and hating those who seem to fly effortlessly. He feels lost and tired.

Zarathustra looks at the tall, lonely tree. It's grown so high it has no one to understand it. It waits, perhaps for lightning to strike. The youth then confesses that he longed for destruction when he aimed high, and Zarathustra feels like the lightning he was waiting for. Envy of Zarathustra has destroyed him.

Zarathustra comforts the youth. He says the youth isn't free yet; he *seeks* freedom, but is still a prisoner in some ways. His "wild dogs" (impulses) want freedom too. He needs to purify himself further. Zarathustra urges him not to lose hope or love. Being noble means others, even the "good," will see you as an obstacle. The danger for a noble person isn't becoming "good" (conservative), but becoming cynical or destructive if they lose their highest hope. He tells the youth, "Maintain holy thy highest hope! Cast not away the hero in thy soul!"

---

**IX. The Preachers of Death**

Zarathustra identifies different types of people who effectively preach turning away from life – the "Preachers of Death."

First, there are the "terrible ones" filled with inner conflict, torn between destructive lusts and self-hatred. They aren't fully human yet and should just pass away.

Second, the "spiritually consumptive" – those born tired, longing for rest and renunciation, essentially wanting death from the start. We shouldn't try to revive them.

Third, those who see any suffering (illness, old age, death) and immediately declare "Life is refuted!" They see only one negative aspect of existence. They wait eagerly for death or distract themselves with small pleasures while clinging weakly to life.

Fourth, those who say "Life is only suffering," urging self-destruction.

Fifth, those who preach against lust and having children, calling birth troublesome or only producing the unfortunate.

Sixth, those who preach pity as the highest value, saying "Take what I am!" – but their pity might actually make others sick of life, or bind them with chains of obligation. True kindness from them might be wickedness.

He also includes those who find life to be rough labor and constant anxiety. They are tired and ripe for the sermon of death. Their diligence is just a way to flee from themselves. Zarathustra says the earth is full of these "superfluous" people to whom death, or "life eternal," needs to be preached, just so they pass away quickly.

---

**X. War and Warriors**

Zarathustra addresses his "brethren in war" – not literal soldiers necessarily, but those who fight spiritually for their ideas. He says he loves them and is their counterpart, but also their best enemy, because he will tell them the truth.

He tells them not to be ashamed of hatred and envy if they feel it; be great enough to own it. If they can't be saints of knowledge, they should at least be its *warriors*. He prefers warriors to mere soldiers in uniform.

They should seek *their* enemy, wage war for their *thoughts*. Even if their thoughts fail, their honesty in fighting for them is a triumph. Love peace only as a *means* to new wars (new struggles, new challenges). The short peace is better than the long one.

His advice: Fight, don't just work. Seek victory, not just peace. "It is the good *war* which halloweth every cause," not the other way around. Bravery has saved more people than sympathy. Being brave *is* good.

He acknowledges they might seem heartless or ugly, but tells them to embrace the "mantle of the ugly," the sublime. True warriors should only have enemies worthy of hate, not contempt. Be proud of your enemies. Obedience can be a strength, even commanding can be a form of obeying a higher principle.

Their highest hope and thought, commanded by Zarathustra, should be: "Man is something that is to be surpassed." They should live their lives as obedience to this goal and as a constant battle. Warriors don't wish to be spared long life. Zarathustra concludes: "I spare you not, I love you from my very heart, my brethren in war!"

---

**XI. The New Idol**

Zarathustra makes a sharp distinction between organic "peoples" (groups united by culture, values, creativity) and the "State." The State, he says, is the "coldest of all cold monsters."

It lies constantly, especially when it claims "I, the state, am the people." Real peoples were created by creators who hung faith and love over them. The state, however, is created by destroyers who lay traps, hanging swords and desires over people. Where a real people exists, the state is hated.

The state mixes up good and evil, steals its power, and speaks lies. It's a sign of the "will to death." It was invented for the "many-too-many," the "superfluous" people, enticing them, consuming them. It roars about its own greatness ("On earth there is nothing greater than I").

Even great souls can be seduced by its lies, especially when they grow weary of conflict. The state sets up false heroes around itself, basking in fake morality. It buys loyalty by giving things, purchasing the appearance of virtue. It uses noble-seeming people to lure the masses. It glorifies dying for it as if that were life.

The state is where everyone drinks poison (metaphorically), where individuality is lost, where "slow suicide" is called "life." The superfluous steal ideas and call it culture, get rich but become poorer in spirit, seek power but remain impotent. They scramble over each other like apes trying to reach the throne, which often sits on filth.

Zarathustra urges escape from this bad smell, this idolatry of the superfluous, these human sacrifices. He says the earth is still open for great souls, for solitude. True life begins *where the state ceases*. There, the song of the necessary, irreplaceable individual can begin. Beyond the state lie the "rainbow and the bridges of the Superman."

---

**XII. The Flies in the Market-Place**

Zarathustra advises his friend (likely representing any aspiring individual) to flee *into solitude*. The public sphere, the "market-place," is deafening with the noise of "great men" (actors, representers) and stinging with the bites of "little men" (the petty, envious crowd).

Forest and rock offer true silence. The market-place, however, is full of actors and "poison-flies." The public doesn't understand true greatness (creation) but loves the performers who *represent* greatness. The world revolves invisibly around the creators of new values, but the *people* and *glory* revolve around the actors.

These actors have spirit but little conscience; they believe strongly in whatever role they are playing at the moment, especially themselves. They mistake upsetting people for proving something, and driving people mad for convincing them. They only believe in loud, flashy things.

The lover of truth shouldn't be jealous of these impatient, absolute figures in the market-place. True, deep experiences happen away from the noise and fame. Creators have always lived apart.

So, flee solitude! The friend is stung by poisonous flies (the small, pitiable people). They take vengeance unconsciously because they feel small and threatened by greatness. Don't fight them directly; there are too many. They can wear down even a strong structure like raindrops. They want your blood (your energy, your spirit) out of perceived innocence, because their own souls are bloodless.

Even their praise is dangerous – it's obtrusive, wanting to get too close. They flatter like cowards. They suspect anyone great. They punish you for your virtues and only forgive your errors. Your quiet pride offends them. They hate you because you are their "bad conscience," reminding them of their own inadequacy. What is great in you makes them even more poisonous. Flee to where a strong, rough wind blows – you are not meant to be a fly-flap.

---

**XIII. Chastity**

Zarathustra declares his love for the forest, saying cities are bad because they are full of lustful people. He finds the constant focus on sex degrading ("Filth is at the bottom of their souls").

He clarifies he doesn't advise *slaying* instincts but finding *innocence* in them. He doesn't universally advise chastity either. For some, it might be a virtue, but for many, it's almost a vice. Why? Because often, those who practice chastity are still filled with suppressed desire ("doggish lust") that looks out enviously. This lust can even sneak into their supposed virtue and spirituality.

He distrusts people who love tragedies and suffering, suspecting their cruel eyes hide a disguised lust posing as pity. He warns that trying too hard to cast out one's "devil" (lust) can lead to becoming worse, like going "into the swine."

So, chastity should be dissuaded if it's too difficult for someone, as it might lead to inner filth and torment. He notes that truly chaste people (those naturally moderate) are often gentler and laugh more easily, even laughing *at* chastity itself, seeing it as a kind of harmless folly that came to visit them, not something they rigidly imposed.

---

**XIV. The Friend**

Zarathustra explores the nature of friendship, especially for the solitary individual (the "anchorite"). Being alone ("I and me") can become too intense; a friend is needed as a "third one," like a cork preventing the conversation from sinking too deep. Solitary people long for a friend and the friend's uplifting presence.

Our desire for a friend reveals our own need for validation. Sometimes, love is just a way to overcome envy. Sometimes we make enemies to hide our vulnerability. True reverence might say "Be at least mine enemy!" rather than beg for friendship.

To have a friend, you must be willing to fight for them, which means you must *be capable of being an enemy*. You should honor the enemy *within* your friend – meaning, you should be closest to them precisely when you challenge or resist them, not just agree or conform.

Showing yourself nakedly (honestly) to a friend is a sign of honor, but it can also shock them. Don't try to be *too* perfect for your friend; instead, be an "arrow and a longing for the Superman" for them.

Seeing a friend asleep reveals their true, perhaps imperfect, face – like seeing yourself in a rough mirror. This reminds us that "man is something that hath to be surpassed." A true friend masters divining (understanding intuitively) and keeping silence. You shouldn't want to see *everything*. Your intuition should tell you what your friend needs, including whether they actually *want* pity. Pity should be hidden under a hard shell, offered with strength.

Are you truly helpful to your friend – like air, solitude, bread, medicine? Can you help them break their own chains? Slaves can't be friends, and tyrants can't have friends. He notes that woman, historically trapped between slave and tyrant roles, isn't yet capable of true friendship; she knows only love, which can be unjust and blind. (Note: This reflects Nietzsche's controversial views on women). He questions if men are truly capable of friendship either, criticizing their "poverty of soul." He concludes: let there be comradeship, but may there *truly* be friendship.

---

**XV. The Thousand and One Goals**

Zarathustra reflects on traveling and seeing many peoples. He found no power greater than the concepts of "good" and "bad." Every people needs to value things to survive, but each values differently from its neighbors. What one honors, another scorns.

A "table of excellencies" (a set of values) hangs over every people, representing their triumphs and their "Will to Power." They praise what they find hard and necessary, what helps them rule, conquer, and shine, making their neighbors envious. Knowing a people's needs and environment helps understand their specific values and goals.

He gives examples: The Greeks valued being foremost and loving only a friend. The Persians valued truth and skill with bow and arrow. Another people valued honoring parents. Another valued fidelity even in dangerous causes.

Crucially, Zarathustra states that humans *gave* themselves all their good and bad. These values weren't found or revealed from heaven; humans *created* them to maintain themselves. Man is the "valuator," the one who creates meaning. Valuation *is* creation.

Changing values means the *creators* are changing. Creators destroy old values. Peoples were the first creators; individuals came later. Early values served the herd. The "ego" came later and was initially seen as bad conscience compared to the herd's good conscience. But it was always loving ones and creators who established good and bad, driven by passion (love and wrath).

Despite seeing a thousand peoples with a thousand different goals (tables of values), Zarathustra finds that humanity *as a whole* still lacks *one* unifying goal. The chain needed to bind the thousand necks together is missing. He ends with a question: If humanity lacks a single goal, does humanity *itself* still truly exist or is it yet to be realized?

---

**XVI. Neighbour-Love**

Zarathustra critiques conventional "love of the neighbour." He says people crowd around their neighbours, but this is often a "bad love of yourselves." People flee *from* themselves *to* their neighbour, trying to make a virtue out of escaping their own company.

He argues the "Thou" (the other person, the neighbour) has been traditionally valued more highly than the "I" (the self). So, he doesn't advise neighbour-love. Instead, he advises "neighbour-*flight*" and "furthest love."

"Furthest love" means love for those distant in space or time – the future ones, the potential yet to be realized. Higher than love for neighbours is love for the "furthest and future ones." Even higher is love for "things and phantoms" – ideals, possibilities, like the Superman running ahead of you. Give yourself to that ideal, not just to the person next door.

People seek neighbours because they can't stand themselves or don't love themselves enough. They try to gain validation through their neighbour's opinion. This association often spoils character. Seeking yourself in the neighbour, or losing yourself in the neighbour – both stem from a bad love of self that makes solitude feel like a prison.

The "furthest ones" pay the price for your focus on the near ones. Even social gatherings (festivals) are suspect – too many actors.

Zarathustra teaches the *Friend*, not the neighbour. The Friend should be a festival, a foretaste of the Superman. The Friend is someone who contains a complete world, a source of goodness, who helps you see potential. Let the future and the furthest be your motivation today. Love the Superman *in* your friend. His final advice: Not neighbour-love, but *furthest love*.

---

**XVII. The Way of the Creating One**

Zarathustra speaks to someone choosing the path of isolation, the path to oneself. He warns that the voice of the "herd" will still echo within them. Feeling pain when separating from the herd's conscience is natural, but that pain comes *from* that same shared conscience.

To go this way, you need strength and authority. Are you a new force, a self-moving wheel, able to compel stars (metaphorically)? Beware of mere ambition or "lusting for loftiness." Great thoughts without action are just hot air.

Are you truly free? Free *from* what is one thing, but free *for* what? Can you create your *own* good and evil, be your *own* judge and avenger? This aloneness is terrifying, like being a star cast into empty space.

You still suffer from the multitude today, but one day solitude itself might weary you. Your pride might break. You might cry "I am alone!" or "All is false!" Feelings that seek to destroy the lonesome one arise; if they fail, they must die – are you capable of being such a "murderer" of your own weaknesses?

Can you endure the "disdain" of others? Can you be just even to those who disdain you? People will resent you for changing, for going past them, for rising higher (envy sees the flyer as smaller). You must accept their injustice as your "allotted portion." Shine like a star anyway.

Beware of the "good and just" – they hate the lonesome one who creates their own virtue and want to crucify them. Beware of "holy simplicity" – it distrusts complexity and loves burning things at the stake. Beware even of your own love – the lonely person reaches out too readily. Sometimes you must offer a clawed paw, not a hand.

Your worst enemy is always *yourself*. You ambush yourself. The path to yourself leads past your "seven devils." You must become a heretic, doubter, even villain *to yourself*. You must be willing to burn in your own flame to become new. The creator creates a God out of his devils. The lover despises himself because he loves himself and wants to create beyond himself. Go into your isolation with love and creation; justice will follow later. Zarathustra loves those who strive to create beyond themselves, even if they perish in the attempt.

**XVIII. Old and Young Women**

Zarathustra recounts an encounter with an old woman. She noted he'd spoken much *to* women, but never *about* woman. He initially resisted, saying one should only talk *to men* about women. But she insisted, saying she was old enough to forget it soon anyway.

So, Zarathustra shares his thoughts: Everything in woman is a riddle, solved by pregnancy (the child is the purpose). Man is a means for woman. For man, woman is danger and diversion, the "most dangerous plaything." Man should be trained for war, woman for the *recreation* of the warrior. Woman understands children better, but man *is* more childish (playful). Women should find the hidden child in man. Let woman be a plaything, pure and fine, shining with future virtues. Let her hope be "May I bear the Superman!"

Her honor should be in her love: always love *more* than you are loved, never be second. Man should fear woman when she loves (she sacrifices everything) and when she hates (she is "mean," while man is merely "evil"). He uses the analogy of iron hating the loadstone because it attracts but isn't strong enough to pull completely. Man's happiness is "I will," woman's is "He will." Woman feels the world is perfect when obeying out of love. Her soul is a shallow, stormy surface; man's is a deep current she senses but doesn't comprehend.

The old woman responds that these are fine things, especially for the young. She remarks, strangely, that Zarathustra knows little about women, yet is right about them – perhaps because with women, nothing is impossible? As thanks, she offers him a "little truth" of her own, telling him to keep it quiet: "Thou goest to women? Do not forget thy whip!" (This infamous line is presented as the *old woman's* wisdom, given *to* Zarathustra).

**XIX. The Bite of the Adder**

Zarathustra tells a story: He fell asleep under a fig tree. An adder (viper) bit him on the neck. He woke up screaming, looked at the snake, and it recognized his eyes and tried to flee awkwardly. Zarathustra stopped it, saying, "You haven't received my thanks yet! You woke me in time, my journey is still long." The adder sadly replied its poison was fatal and his journey short. Zarathustra smiled: "When did a dragon ever die of a serpent's poison? Take your poison back! You aren't rich enough to give it to me." The adder then licked his wound.

His disciples asked for the moral. Zarathustra answered: The good and just call *him* the destroyer of morality, so *his* story is immoral. His advice, derived from the story:
If you have an enemy, don't return good for evil – that just embarrasses them. Instead, show them they actually did something *good* for you (like the snake waking him).
Better to be angry than to embarrass someone. If cursed, don't just bless – curse back a little!
If you suffer a great injustice, commit five small ones yourself. Shared injustice is half justice. He who can bear it should take injustice upon himself.
Small revenge is more human than none. Punishment should be an honor to the transgressor, not just cold justice from an executioner's eye.
It's nobler to admit you're wrong than insist you're right, especially if you *are* right (but you need to be "rich enough" – strong enough – to do so).
He seeks justice which is "love with seeing eyes," love that bears guilt as well as punishment, justice that acquits everyone except the judge. Even a lie can be philanthropic if done justly from the heart.
His own form of justice: giving everyone *his own* (what *he* has to give).
Finally, a warning: Don't wrong a solitary person (anchorite). They are like deep wells; if you throw a stone in, who will get it out? They don't forget or easily requite. If you *do* injure one, you might as well kill them too.

**XX. Child and Marriage**

Zarathustra poses a question directly to his "brother" (representing an individual): Are you *entitled* to desire a child and marriage?

Are you victorious over yourself? A self-conqueror? Master of your virtues? Or does your desire come from animal instinct, necessity, loneliness, or inner conflict?

Your victory and freedom should *long* for a child. You should build living monuments to your self-overcoming. You must first build *yourself* properly, "rectangular in body and soul." You should propagate *upward*, not just onward. Marriage should help with this.

He defines true marriage: the will of *two* people to create *one* who is *more* than they are. It involves reverence for each other as people attempting this high goal.

This contrasts sharply with what the "many-too-many," the "superfluous," call marriage. Zarathustra finds their marriages marked by poverty of soul, filth of soul, and pitiable self-complacency. He mocks the idea that these marriages are "made in heaven." He sees mismatches everywhere (a saint and a goose). Men seeking truth end up with a small lie called marriage. Careful choosers spoil their lives with one bad choice called marriage. Buyers are careful, but still buy their wife "in a sack."

What people call "love" is often just "many short follies." Marriage then becomes "one long stupidity." Love between men and women is rarely sympathy for gods hidden in suffering; usually, it's just "two animals" finding each other. Even the *best* love is just a painful, beautiful metaphor, a torch lighting the way to *higher* paths.

You must eventually learn to love *beyond* yourselves. First, learn to love properly. This involves drinking the "bitter cup" of love. Bitterness in love creates longing for the Superman, thirst in the creator. Is *this* thirst for the Superman your will to marriage? Such a will and such a marriage, Zarathustra calls holy.

**XXI. Voluntary Death**

Zarathustra tackles the subject of death. Many die too late, some too early. The strange teaching is: "Die at the right time!" How can someone who never *lives* at the right time, *die* at the right time? He advises the "superfluous" (those who shouldn't have been born) accordingly.

Even the superfluous make a big deal of death. But death isn't yet a festival. People haven't learned how to celebrate the *best* kind of death: the "consummating death." This is the death of someone who has fulfilled their purpose, dying triumphantly, surrounded by hope, becoming a promise to the living. That's how one should learn to die. Dying in battle, sacrificing a great soul, is the second best.

Hateful is the "grinning death" that sneaks up like a thief but acts like a master (i.e., natural death from decay or random illness). Zarathustra praises *his* death: the *voluntary* death, which comes because *he wants it*.

When should one want it? When one has a goal and an heir (someone or something to carry on the purpose). Out of reverence for the goal, one shouldn't cling to life when withered. Don't be like rope-makers who lengthen their rope by always going backward.

Many outlive their truths and triumphs. One must practice the difficult art of *going* at the right time, leaving when one "tastes best" to be remembered fondly. Some hearts age first, others spirits. Some are old in youth, others stay young late. For many, life is a failure, eaten by a poison-worm. Let their dying be a success, then!

Too many live too long, clinging like rotten fruit. Zarathustra wishes for "preachers of *speedy* death" to shake these rotten ones from the tree of life. Instead, he only hears preachers of *slow* death and patience with earthly things. But the earth has too much patience with *them*!

He critiques Jesus, saying he died too early, knowing only tears, melancholy, and hatred from the "good and just." If Jesus had lived longer, perhaps in the wilderness, he might have learned to live, love the earth, and laugh. He would have been noble enough to *disavow* his own early doctrines. He was immature. Man understands life and death better than youth.

Be free *for* death, and free *in* death. Know when to say "No" to life because it's no longer time for "Yes." Let your dying not be a reproach to humanity and the earth. Let your spirit and virtue shine like an after-glow. Zarathustra wants to die this way himself, returning to the earth that bore him, so his friends will love the earth more for his sake. He had a goal (like throwing a ball); now his friends are the heirs, and he throws the golden ball to them. He'll stay a little longer to see them play.

**XXII. The Bestowing Virtue**

**(Part 1)**

Zarathustra leaves the town "The Pied Cow," followed by disciples. At a crossroad, he says he must go alone. They give him a staff with a gold handle: a serpent coiled around the sun. Zarathustra is pleased.

He asks them: Why is gold the highest value? Because it's uncommon, seemingly useless ("unprofiting"), radiant, soft, and it always *bestows itself*. Gold is an image of the *highest virtue*, which is the "bestowing virtue." This virtue is also uncommon, unprofiting, radiant, and soft – it gives of itself.

He tells his disciples he sees they strive for this same bestowing virtue. Their souls eagerly gather treasures *so that* they can give them away again, flowing out like gifts from a fountain. This "bestowing love" must become an appropriator of values, but this kind of selfishness is healthy and holy.

There's another kind of selfishness: poor, hungry, sickly, always wanting to steal, looking enviously at abundance. This comes from sickness and degeneration. Degeneration is the worst thing, always suspected when the bestowing soul is lacking.

Our path goes upward, from generation to super-generation (towards the Superman). The degenerating sense says "All for myself." Our sense, striving upward, is like our body striving and fighting through history. Spirit is the body's herald and echo. Names of virtues are just similes, hinting at elevated states of the body and spirit. Your virtue originates when your spirit speaks in similes, when your body is elevated, when your heart overflows like a river (a blessing and danger), when you're beyond praise and blame, when you despise easy comfort, when you will *one* thing intensely. This new virtue is power, a ruling thought with a subtle soul around it, like a golden sun with the serpent of knowledge.

**(Part 2)**

Zarathustra's voice changes. He urges his disciples: Remain *true to the earth* with your virtue's power. Let your bestowing love and knowledge serve the *meaning of the earth*. Don't let virtue fly away to "eternal walls." Too much virtue has flown away; lead it back to the earth, back to body and life, to give the earth a *human* meaning.

Spirit and virtue have blundered hundreds of times. Man is an attempt, full of ignorance and error. We inherit not just millennia of rationality but also madness. We still fight giant Chance; nonsense has ruled humanity.

Let your spirit and virtue serve the *sense of the earth*. Determine the value of everything anew. Be fighters! Be creators! The body purifies itself intelligently. Physician, heal *thyself* first!

There are thousands of untrodden paths, undiscovered islands of life. Man and his world are not exhausted. Awake, lonesome ones! Good tidings come from the future. You lonesome ones today will become a people, a chosen people, and out of you will arise the Superman. The earth will become a place of healing, with a new, salvation-bringing odour and hope.

**(Part 3)**

Zarathustra pauses again, then speaks with another change in voice. He tells his disciples he must now go alone, and they must *also* go away alone. This is his will.

He advises them: Depart from *him*, guard against *him*. Be ashamed of him! Perhaps he deceived them. A student repays a teacher badly by remaining only a student. Don't just cling to his ideas ("pluck at my wreath").

They venerate him now, but what if that collapses? A statue can crush you. They believe *in* Zarathustra, but what is Zarathustra? What are believers? Belief itself is of little account. They found him because they hadn't yet sought *themselves*.

His command: "Lose me and find yourselves." Only when they have all *denied* him (moved beyond his specific teachings to find their own way) will he return to them. He will return with different eyes, a different love. They will become friends again, children of one hope. He will be with them a third time to celebrate the "great noontide."

The great noontide is when humanity is midway between animal and Superman, celebrating the path towards evening (the end of current humanity) as the highest hope, because it leads to a *new morning*. The "down-goer" (one who overcomes current humanity) blesses himself as an "over-goer." The sun of knowledge is at its peak.

The final will at the great noontide: "DEAD ARE ALL THE GODS: NOW DO WE DESIRE THE SUPERMAN TO LIVE."

Thus spake Zarathustra, ending the first part of his discourses.
