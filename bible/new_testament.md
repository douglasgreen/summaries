# New Testament, World English Bible

## Matthew

Next up, we have the Gospel According to Matthew.

This book opens the New Testament and introduces us to Jesus Christ. Matthew really wants us to see Jesus as the promised King – the Messiah expected by the Jewish people.

He starts right off showing Jesus's family line, connecting him back to King David and Abraham, fulfilling ancient promises. We read about Jesus's miraculous birth, the visit from the wise men looking for the newborn king, and how his family had to flee to Egypt for safety.

Then, we meet John the Baptist, preparing the way for Jesus. Jesus gets baptized, and God's voice declares him His Son. After facing temptation in the wilderness, Jesus begins his public ministry in Galilee.

He starts teaching about the 'Kingdom of Heaven' – that's a big theme in Matthew. He calls his first disciples, ordinary fishermen, to follow him.

Matthew includes large sections of Jesus's teachings. The most famous is the Sermon on the Mount, found in chapters 5 to 7. It's full of wisdom on how to live a life that pleases God – covering things like prayer, forgiveness, worry, and loving your enemies.

Throughout the book, Jesus performs amazing miracles: healing the sick, calming storms, even raising the dead. These acts show his power and authority as God's Son. He also teaches using parables – simple stories with deep spiritual meanings about what God's Kingdom is like.

Matthew often points out how Jesus's life fulfills prophecies from the Old Testament, reinforcing that he is the long-awaited Messiah.

As Jesus's ministry grows, so does the opposition from the religious leaders. They challenge his authority and eventually plot against him. Peter declares that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, but Jesus also starts telling his disciples that he must suffer, die in Jerusalem, and then rise again.

The final part of the book details Jesus's arrival in Jerusalem, his Last Supper with the disciples, his betrayal by Judas, his arrest, trial, and crucifixion under Pontius Pilate. It's a powerful and moving account of his sacrifice.

But the story doesn't end in death! Matthew joyfully recounts Jesus's resurrection on the third day. He appears to his followers, proving he has conquered death.

The book closes with Jesus giving his disciples the 'Great Commission' – sending them out to make disciples of all nations, baptizing them and teaching them to obey his commands. And he gives them a wonderful promise: 'I am with you always, even to the end of the age.'

So, Matthew presents Jesus as the King and Messiah, the great Teacher, the miracle worker, and the resurrected Savior who sends his followers into the world.
