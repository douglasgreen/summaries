# Art of War, by Sun Tzu

## Chapter 1

This chapter, "Laying Plans," establishes the critical importance of warfare to the state, viewing it as a matter of life and death that demands careful consideration.

Sun Tzu introduces **five fundamental factors** that govern the outcome of war and must be assessed before engaging:

1.  **The Moral Law:** The unity and harmony between the ruler and the people, ensuring they will fight willingly.
2.  **Heaven:** Environmental conditions like weather, time of day, and seasons.
3.  **Earth:** The terrain, distances, and strategic nature of the ground.
4.  **The Commander:** The leader's qualities, including wisdom, integrity, courage, and discipline.
5.  **Method and Discipline:** The army's organization, command structure, logistics, and financial management.

Mastering these five factors is essential for victory. Sun Tzu then provides **seven considerations** for comparing oneself with the enemy based on these factors (e.g., which leader is more capable, who has advantages of Heaven/Earth, which army is better disciplined/trained). This comparison allows for forecasting victory or defeat.

The chapter stresses the importance of **calculation and planning** *before* battle, stating that thorough calculations lead to victory, while few or none lead to defeat.

Crucially, Sun Tzu introduces the core principle that **all warfare is based on deception**. He advises appearing weak when strong, inactive when deploying forces, near when far, and vice-versa, using baits, feigning disorder, and exploiting the enemy's weaknesses (like anger or complacency) to gain an advantage. These specific tactics, however, should be kept secret.

In essence, Chapter 1 argues that success in war hinges on **rigorous preliminary assessment, meticulous planning, understanding fundamental factors, and mastering the art of deception.**

## Chapter 2

This chapter focuses on the **immense economic burden and strategic risks of prolonged warfare**. Sun Tzu emphasizes that maintaining a large army in the field is incredibly expensive, quickly draining the state's resources and impoverishing the people through high costs and taxes.

He argues that **long campaigns are detrimental**: they dull weapons, dampen troop morale, exhaust strength, and deplete the treasury. This weakened state invites attacks from rivals. Therefore, while "stupid haste" is possible, **cleverness is never associated with long delays** in warfare, and no nation has ever benefited from a protracted war.

To mitigate these costs and dangers, Sun Tzu advocates for **swift, decisive action** with the primary goal being **victory**, not lengthy campaigns. A key strategy is to **forage on the enemy** for supplies, as this is far more efficient than relying on long, costly supply lines from home. He also advises motivating troops through anger and rewards, and **integrating captured enemy soldiers and equipment** to augment one's own strength.

Ultimately, the chapter underscores that **understanding the heavy costs and inherent evils of war is crucial** for waging it effectively. The general's ability to achieve quick victory is paramount, making them the "arbiter of the people's fate," deciding whether the nation remains at peace or falls into peril.

## Chapter 3

This chapter champions **achieving victory through strategy and intelligence over direct combat and destruction**. Sun Tzu states that the highest form of generalship is to **subdue the enemy without fighting**. Capturing the enemy's state, armies, or units intact is far superior to destroying them.

He outlines a hierarchy of strategic approaches:
1.  **Best:** Thwart the enemy's plans (through diplomacy, intelligence, etc.).
2.  **Next Best:** Prevent the enemy's forces from uniting.
3.  **Next:** Attack the enemy's army in the open field.
4.  **Worst:** Besiege walled cities, which is costly, time-consuming, and often results in heavy casualties even if successful. Sieges should be avoided if possible.

The skillful leader aims to take objectives without sieges and overthrow kingdoms without lengthy campaigns, preserving their own forces.

The chapter also provides practical guidance based on **relative strength**: surround the enemy if you outnumber them 10:1, attack if 5:1, divide and attack if 2:1, be prepared to fight if evenly matched, avoid if outnumbered, and flee if significantly weaker.

Sun Tzu stresses the **general's crucial role** as the "bulwark of the State" and warns against **three ways a ruler can undermine their own army**:
1.  Issuing orders the army cannot realistically follow ("hobbling the army").
2.  Governing the army with civilian administrative methods, causing unrest.
3.  Appointing officers without understanding military needs and adaptability, shaking soldier confidence.
Such interference leads to chaos and invites defeat.

Finally, he lists **five essential elements for knowing victory**:
1.  Knowing when to fight and when not to.
2.  Knowing how to handle different force sizes (superior/inferior).
3.  Ensuring the army shares a unified spirit.
4.  Being prepared and exploiting the enemy's lack of preparation.
5.  Having military competence without interference from the sovereign.

The chapter concludes with the famous maxim: **"If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle."** This underscores the paramount importance of intelligence and self-assessment for strategic success.

## Chapter 4

This chapter emphasizes the critical importance of **securing oneself against defeat before seeking victory**. Sun Tzu argues that the truly skilled warrior first makes themselves invulnerable ("beyond the possibility of defeat") through strong defensive positioning and preparation. This invincibility lies within one's own control.

However, the **opportunity to actually defeat the enemy depends on the enemy making mistakes** or presenting vulnerabilities. Therefore, one can know *how* to win but may not always be *able* to win immediately; one must wait for the right moment.

Sun Tzu defines **true military excellence not as winning obvious, hard-fought battles, but as winning with ease** by exploiting an enemy who is already positioned for defeat due to their own errors. Such victories, achieved through flawless preparation and making no mistakes, might not even bring fame or recognition, but they represent the highest skill.

The victorious strategist, therefore, **ensures victory through calculation and positioning *before* engaging in battle**. In contrast, the destined loser fights first and then hopes for a favorable outcome.

The chapter introduces a sequence for achieving this calculated assurance: **Measurement** (of terrain/conditions), **Estimation** (of forces/quantities), **Calculation** (comparing strengths/weaknesses), **Balancing of chances**, which ultimately leads to **Victory**.

Adherence to **Moral Law and Method/Discipline** (from Chapter 1) allows the commander to control the factors leading to success. The chapter concludes by emphasizing the overwhelming power that results from correct tactical dispositions, likening it to a pound crushing a grain or pent-up water bursting forth. In essence, it's about **creating the conditions for inevitable victory through careful positioning and calculation.**

## Chapter 5

This chapter focuses on the **dynamic application of military force, momentum, and the creative use of tactics**. Sun Tzu begins by stating that managing large armies relies on the same principles as small ones: effective **organization, subdivision, and clear signs/signals**.

The core concept introduced is the interplay between the **direct (cheng / 正)** and the **indirect (qi / 奇)** methods of attack.
*   The **direct** method is used to engage the enemy, fix their attention, and join battle conventionally.
*   The **indirect** method involves surprise, flanking maneuvers, unconventional tactics, and exploiting opportunities to secure victory.

Sun Tzu emphasizes that while there are only these two fundamental approaches, their combinations are **inexhaustible and endlessly adaptable**, like the interplay of musical notes, colors, or tastes. Skillful commanders constantly cycle between direct and indirect tactics to confuse and overwhelm the enemy.

To achieve victory, the army's impact must be focused and overwhelming, like a "grindstone dashed against an egg," by exploiting the enemy's **weak points**. The attack's execution requires **decisive timing and speed**, likened to a "torrent rolling stones" or a "falcon's stoop." This involves building up potential **energy** (like a "bent crossbow") and releasing it decisively ("releasing the trigger").

Crucially, Sun Tzu discusses using **deception based on underlying strength**:
*   **Simulated disorder** requires perfect discipline.
*   **Simulated fear** requires real courage.
*   **Simulated weakness** requires actual strength.
By presenting these false appearances, a commander can lure the enemy into traps and advantageous situations, using baits and keeping them constantly reacting.

Finally, the chapter stresses the importance of **"combined energy"** – focusing on the collective momentum and synergy of the force rather than relying solely on individual abilities. A good commander utilizes the combined energy of their troops, making them like **"rolling logs or stones"** that, once set in motion correctly, gather unstoppable momentum down a slope.

In essence, Chapter V is about using organization, the flexible combination of direct and indirect tactics, decisive action, deception, and collective momentum to generate overwhelming and unpredictable force.

## Chapter 6

This chapter focuses on **gaining the initiative and exploiting the enemy's weaknesses through strategic positioning, concentration of force, and adaptability.**

Sun Tzu emphasizes the advantage of **being proactive**: arriving first on the battlefield ensures freshness, while forcing the enemy to react leads to their exhaustion. The skilled commander **imposes their will** on the enemy, manipulating their movements through lures (advantages) or threats (inflicting damage).

The key is to **attack undefended points and appear where unexpected**. This requires **secrecy and subtlety** ("divine art") to keep your own dispositions hidden while discovering the enemy's. By remaining formless and unpredictable, the commander forces the enemy to **divide their forces** to guard against multiple potential threats, thus weakening themselves everywhere.

This allows the skilled commander to **concentrate their own unified force against dispersed segments of the enemy**, achieving local numerical superiority even if outnumbered overall ("pitting a whole against parts of a whole"). Victory comes from attacking these identified weak points. Knowing the time and place of battle allows for this concentration.

Sun Tzu stresses the need to **probe the enemy** ("rouse him," "force him to reveal himself") to uncover their plans, patterns, and vulnerabilities. Comparing forces identifies where strength and weakness lie on both sides.

Crucially, the highest skill is to **conceal one's own tactical dispositions**. While observers might see the specific tactics used in a victory, they cannot perceive the underlying strategy and adaptability that created the winning conditions.

The chapter concludes by comparing military tactics to **water**: it avoids heights (strength) and flows downwards (towards weakness), constantly adapting its course to the terrain (the enemy and circumstances). There are **no fixed tactics or constant conditions** in warfare. True mastery lies in the ability to **modify plans in relation to the opponent and the situation**, much like nature's cycles (elements, seasons, moon).

## Chapter 7

This chapter delves into the complexities and critical importance of **tactical maneuvering** – moving the army effectively to gain an advantageous position before battle. Sun Tzu states that maneuvering is difficult, requiring the skill to turn **indirect routes into direct advantages ("artifice of deviation")** and turn potential misfortune into gain.

He warns against the **dangers and logistical strains** of maneuvering, particularly forced marches aimed at snatching a quick advantage. Such haste can lead to exhaustion, separation of troops (strong ahead, weak behind), and the loss of crucial supplies and baggage, rendering the army vulnerable and potentially arriving too late or understrength. An army **cannot survive without its supply train**.

Effective maneuvering requires **thorough preparation**: familiarity with the terrain (mountains, swamps, etc.), the use of **local guides**, and awareness of neighboring powers' intentions before forming alliances.

Execution demands **dissimulation (deception)** and moving only when there is a clear advantage. The army's movement should possess specific qualities: **rapidity like the wind, compactness like the forest, aggression like fire, and steadfastness like a mountain**. Plans should be concealed like night, and attacks launched decisively like a thunderbolt.

For large armies, maintaining **command and control** during maneuvers is vital, achieved through signals like gongs, drums, flags, and banners to unify focus and action, preventing individuals from advancing or retreating alone.

Sun Tzu emphasizes exploiting the **enemy's psychological state and physical condition**: attack when the enemy's morale is low (sluggish, tired, evening) and avoid them when keen (morning); maintain discipline and calm while waiting for enemy disorder; conserve your own strength (be rested, fed, close to the goal) while the enemy is tired, hungry, and far off.

The chapter concludes with several key **tactical maxims**:
*   Do not attack enemies uphill.
*   Do not pursue feigned retreats.
*   Do not attack troops with keen morale.
*   Do not swallow enemy bait.
*   Do not impede an army returning home.
*   When surrounding an enemy, leave an escape route.
*   Do not press a desperate foe too hard.

In essence, successful maneuvering is a calculated art involving logistical awareness, deception, adaptability, timing, psychological insight, and adherence to specific tactical principles to secure advantage before combat begins.

## Chapter 8

This chapter emphasizes the crucial importance of **adaptability and flexibility** in military command. Sun Tzu begins by outlining specific tactical responses to different types of terrain and situations (e.g., don't camp in difficult terrain, use stratagem when hemmed-in, fight when desperate).

Crucially, he asserts that **no rule is absolute**. There are times when conventional wisdom or even direct orders must be disregarded: roads that shouldn't be followed, armies not to be attacked, towns not to be besieged, and even **commands from the sovereign that must not be obeyed** if circumstances on the ground demand otherwise.

A general's effectiveness hinges on understanding **how and when to vary tactics**. Simply knowing the terrain or basic principles isn't enough; the ability to adapt plans based on the evolving situation is paramount. Wise planning involves **blending considerations of advantage and disadvantage**, always being ready to seize an opportunity amidst difficulties.

The focus should be on **proactive readiness** – relying not on the enemy's inaction, but on one's own preparedness and making one's position unassailable. This involves actively creating problems for the enemy and luring them into unfavorable situations.

Sun Tzu then identifies **five dangerous faults in a general** that impede adaptability and lead to ruin:
1.  **Recklessness:** Leading to destruction.
2.  **Cowardice:** Leading to capture.
3.  **Hasty Temper:** Easily provoked by insults or frustration.
4.  **Delicate Sense of Honor:** Overly sensitive to shame or reputation.
5.  **Over-solicitude for Men:** Leading to hesitation, worry, and inability to make tough decisions.

These five flaws are presented as fundamental weaknesses that inevitably cause defeat and the leader's demise. They must be recognized and consciously avoided. In essence, Chapter VIII champions **flexible thinking, situational judgment, and avoiding personal character flaws** that prevent necessary tactical variations.

## Chapter 9

This chapter provides practical advice on **moving armies, selecting advantageous campsites, and interpreting signs to understand the enemy's situation and intentions.**

Sun Tzu details specific tactics for different terrains:
*   **Mountains:** Pass quickly, stay near valleys, camp high and facing the sun, avoid fighting uphill.
*   **Rivers:** Get distance after crossing, attack invaders only after half have crossed, camp upstream and facing the sun.
*   **Salt Marshes:** Cross quickly without delay, if forced to fight, secure water/grass and have trees to your back.
*   **Flat Country:** Take accessible positions with high ground to the rear/right for security.

He emphasizes camping on **high, sunny, and firm ground** for tactical advantage and the health of the troops, avoiding disease. Dangerous terrain (cliffs, thickets, swamps) should be left quickly or used to trap the enemy. Areas near camp suitable for ambush must be thoroughly scouted.

A significant portion of the chapter focuses on **interpreting enemy signs**:
*   **Position/Movement:** Quietness implies confidence in terrain; provoking battle means they want you to advance; an easily accessible camp is likely bait.
*   **Visual Cues:** Dust clouds indicate chariots or infantry; movement in trees signals advance; rising birds suggest ambush; startled beasts mean a surprise attack.
*   **Behavior/Demeanor:** Humble words with preparations mean advance; violent words mean retreat; peace offers without oaths are plots; troops running into rank signal a critical moment; soldiers leaning on spears are hungry; those drinking first when getting water are thirsty; frequent rewards/punishments suggest desperation; whispers indicate disaffection; feeding horses grain and killing cattle signals a fight to the death.
*   **Camp Conditions:** Night clamor means nervousness; shifting flags indicate sedition; angry officers mean weary men.

The chapter also touches upon strategy when numbers are equal (concentrate strength, be vigilant) and warns against underestimating the opponent.

Finally, Sun Tzu addresses **troop management**: treat soldiers with humanity first to gain attachment, but maintain **iron discipline** by consistently enforcing commands and punishments *after* attachment is formed. This balance is crucial for creating an effective and submissive army, leading to mutual gain and victory.

## Chapter 10

This chapter analyzes **six distinct types of terrain** and the tactical considerations associated with each:

1.  **Accessible Ground:** Open to both sides; occupy high, sunny spots first and guard supply lines.
2.  **Entangling Ground:** Easy to leave but hard to return; only attack if the enemy is unprepared, as retreat is difficult.
3.  **Temporising Ground:** Neither side gains by moving first; lure the enemy out before attacking.
4.  **Narrow Passes:** Occupy first and defend strongly; attack only if the enemy holds it weakly.
5.  **Precipitous Heights:** Occupy high, sunny spots first; if the enemy is there first, retreat and lure them away.
6.  **Distant Positions:** If forces are equal, avoid initiating battle as distance creates disadvantages.

Mastering these terrain principles is crucial for any responsible general.

Sun Tzu then identifies **six calamities** that lead to defeat, attributing them not to nature but to **faults of the general**:
1.  **Flight:** Attacking with vastly inferior numbers.
2.  **Insubordination:** Common soldiers too strong relative to weak officers.
3.  **Collapse:** Officers too strong relative to weak soldiers.
4.  **Ruin:** Insubordinate officers engaging rashly without orders.
5.  **Disorganization:** Weak general, unclear orders, poorly structured ranks.
6.  **Rout:** Poor assessment of enemy strength, using weak troops against strong ones.

While terrain ("Earth") is a key ally, a great general must also **estimate the enemy, control victory factors, and calculate difficulties/distances**. True understanding leads to victory. This includes the critical judgment to **fight only when victory is certain (even against the ruler's orders)** and refuse battle when it is not (even if ordered).

The ideal general values **protecting the country and serving the sovereign above personal fame or disgrace**. They should treat soldiers with care ("like children") to foster loyalty, but must also **enforce commands and maintain discipline**; indulgence without authority renders soldiers useless.

Finally, Sun Tzu emphasizes that complete victory requires knowing **more than just oneself and the enemy**. One must also know if the **enemy is vulnerable**, if **one's own troops are ready**, *and* if the **terrain ("Earth") and conditions ("Heaven") are favorable** for battle. Knowing all these factors ensures victory is not in doubt.

## Chapter 11

This extensive chapter classifies the terrain or strategic context of operations into **nine distinct situations**, each demanding a different tactical approach:

1.  **Dispersive Ground:** Fighting in one's own territory; troops tend to scatter. (Don't fight; focus on unity).
2.  **Facile Ground:** Shallow penetration into enemy territory. (Don't halt; maintain connections).
3.  **Contentious Ground:** Strategically vital ground advantageous to either side. (Don't attack unprepared; secure it quickly).
4.  **Open Ground:** Both sides have freedom of movement. (Don't block the enemy; watch defenses).
5.  **Ground of Intersecting Highways:** Key terrain controlling access to multiple areas. (Form alliances).
6.  **Serious Ground:** Deep inside enemy territory with fortified cities behind. (Focus on plunder/supply; ensure cohesion).
7.  **Difficult Ground:** Hard-to-traverse terrain (mountains, marshes). (Keep moving steadily).
8.  **Hemmed-in Ground:** Entry/exit through narrow passes, vulnerable to small forces. (Resort to stratagem; block retreat).
9.  **Desperate Ground:** No escape; must fight immediately to survive. (Fight decisively).

Sun Tzu emphasizes that a skilled commander adapts their strategy based on these situations. Key principles highlighted include:

*   **Rapidity:** Speed is crucial, exploiting enemy unreadiness and attacking unguarded spots.
*   **Cohesion:** Penetrating deep into enemy territory naturally fosters troop solidarity.
*   **Psychology:** Placing soldiers in **desperate ground** (burning boats, breaking pots, cutting off retreat) removes fear and forces them to fight with maximum ferocity and unity, like the mythical **shuai-jan snake** that fights with head and tail simultaneously.
*   **Deception:** Mystify your own troops and the enemy with false appearances and changing plans to maintain unpredictability.
*   **Focus:** Target something the enemy holds dear to gain leverage.
*   **Leadership:** The general must be calm, secret, just, adaptable, and decisive, leading the army as a single unit and making them commit fully ("kick away the ladder").
*   **Adaptability:** Constantly adjust plans based on the enemy and the situation, accommodating their purpose until a decisive blow can be struck. Exhibit caution initially ("coyness of a maiden"), then strike swiftly ("rapidity of a running hare").

The chapter reiterates the need for familiarity with terrain, local guides, and neighbors' designs. Ultimately, it stresses that understanding these nine situations, the laws of human nature, and the principles of aggression/defense, and adapting fluidly to them, is fundamental to generalship and achieving victory.

## Chapter 12

This chapter details the use of **fire as a tactical weapon** and transitions into broader principles of **caution and decision-making in war**.

Sun Tzu identifies **five targets for fire attacks**: enemy soldiers in camp, supply stores, baggage trains, arsenals/magazines, and dropping fire onto enemy formations. He stresses the need for **readiness**, having the necessary materials prepared, and choosing the **right conditions** – specifically dry weather and windy days (linked astrologically) – for launching fire attacks.

Commanders must anticipate **five developments** when using fire:
1.  If fire starts inside the enemy camp, attack immediately from outside.
2.  If fire starts but the enemy remains calm, wait and observe.
3.  Attack when the fire is at its peak, if feasible; otherwise, wait.
4.  Fire attacks can be initiated from outside; don't always wait for an internal outbreak.
5.  Always position yourself **to windward** when starting a fire and avoid attacking from the leeward side.

Sun Tzu notes that using fire shows **intelligence**, while using water adds strength (but mainly intercepts, doesn't destroy).

The chapter then broadens its scope, warning against waging war without **"the spirit of enterprise,"** which leads to stagnation. It strongly emphasizes that **enlightened rulers and good generals plan carefully and cultivate resources.**

Crucially, Sun Tzu advises extreme **caution**:
*   **Move only if there's an advantage.**
*   **Use troops only if there's something to gain.**
*   **Fight only if the position is critical.**
*   **Never act out of anger (ruler's spleen) or pique (general's frustration).**

He underscores the **finality of war's consequences**: emotions pass, but destroyed kingdoms and lost lives cannot be recovered. Therefore, the wise ruler and general are **heedful and cautious**, aiming to keep the country at peace and the army intact whenever possible.

## Chapter 13

This final chapter underscores the paramount importance of **intelligence and foreknowledge** in warfare, obtained primarily through **espionage**. Sun Tzu begins by reiterating the immense cost of war in treasure and human suffering, arguing that refusing to spend resources on spies to gain crucial information about the enemy is **"the height of inhumanity"** and guarantees failure.

He states that **foreknowledge**—understanding the enemy's dispositions, plans, and condition—is the key factor enabling wise rulers and generals to achieve victories beyond the reach of ordinary men. This knowledge cannot be gained through superstition or abstract calculation; it must come from **human sources**.

Sun Tzu outlines **five types of spies**:
1.  **Local Spies:** Using inhabitants of the enemy's district.
2.  **Inward Spies:** Using enemy officials.
3.  **Converted Spies:** Turning the enemy's own spies against them.
4.  **Doomed Spies:** Knowingly feeding false information through your own spies who are expected to be caught or report back to the enemy.
5.  **Surviving Spies:** Those who return with information from the enemy camp.

Employing all five types effectively constitutes a secret, powerful system ("divine manipulation"). Managing spies requires **utmost secrecy, liberal rewards, close relationships, and personal qualities** like intuition, integrity, and subtlety in the handler. Leaks must be met with the death penalty.

The **Converted Spy** is highlighted as particularly crucial, as they are the primary source for recruiting other spies (Local, Inward) and for planting disinformation via Doomed Spies. They must be treated exceptionally well.

Sun Tzu concludes that only enlightened rulers and wise generals understand the value of espionage and use the "highest intelligence of the army" for this purpose, achieving great results. **Spies are essential because an army's ability to move and act effectively depends entirely on the intelligence they provide.**
